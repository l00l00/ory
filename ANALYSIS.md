# Docker Compose Analysis Report

This report summarizes the analysis of the `ai-auth-stack-full/docker-compose.yml` file.

## Findings and Recommendations:

1.  **Critical: Undefined Environment Variables**
    *   The `docker-compose.yml` file relies on several environment variables that must be defined for the services to function correctly. These variables are typically placed in a `.env` file in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` or set directly in the shell environment.
    *   **Required Variables:**
        *   `EMAIL`: Used by Traefik for Let's Encrypt SSL certificate generation (e.g., `me@example.com`).
        *   `DOMAIN`: The base domain for all services (e.g., `example.com`). Traefik rules will generate hostnames like `traefik.example.com`, `n8n.example.com`, etc.
        *   `TRAEFIK_DASHBOARD_AUTH`: Credentials for accessing the Traefik dashboard, in the format `user:hashed_password`. (e.g., `admin:$apr1$abcdefg$hijklmnop`). You can use `htpasswd` to generate this.
        *   `N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER`: Username for n8n basic authentication.
        *   `N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`: Password for n8n basic authentication.
        *   `FLOWISE_USERNAME`: Username for Flowise AI.
        *   `FLOWISE_PASSWORD`: Password for Flowise AI.
        *   `SUPABASE_DB_PASS`: Password for the PostgreSQL database used by Supabase.
    *   **Action:** Create a `.env` file in the `ai-auth-stack-full` directory and define all the above variables.

2.  **Corrected: Kratos UI Scheme Mismatch**
    *   The `kratos-ui` service had its `KRATOS_BROWSER_URL` environment variable set to `http://auth.${DOMAIN}`.
    *   However, Traefik is configured to serve the `auth.${DOMAIN}` endpoint over HTTPS (`websecure` entrypoint with `leresolver`).
    *   **Change Made:** The `KRATOS_BROWSER_URL` in `docker-compose.yml` has been updated to `https://auth.${DOMAIN}` to align with the HTTPS scheme used by Traefik. This prevents potential mixed content issues or redirect loops.

3.  **Note: Host Port Dependencies (Traefik)**
    *   The `traefik` service maps host ports `80` and `443` to its container.
    *   **Consideration:** Ensure that no other applications on the host machine are using these ports before starting the Docker Compose stack.

4.  **Note: Volume Host Path Prerequisites**
    *   Several services use volume mounts that map to local directories on the host. It's best practice to ensure these directories exist before running `docker-compose up`.
    *   **Directories to pre-create (relative to `ai-auth-stack-full/docker-compose.yml`):**
        *   `./letsencrypt` (for Traefik's Let's Encrypt certificates)
        *   `./data/n8n` (for n8n data persistence)
        *   `./data/flowise` (for Flowise data persistence)
        *   `./kratos` (must contain Kratos configuration files: `kratos.yaml`, `identity.schema.json`)
        *   `./data/postgres` (for PostgreSQL database data)

5.  **No Direct Port Conflicts Between Services**
    *   The services (other than Traefik) do not publish ports directly to the host. They are accessed via Traefik using host-based routing.
    *   Internal port usage (e.g., `flowise` and `kratos-ui` both using internal port `3000`) is not an issue as Traefik routes to the correct container based on the hostname.

## General Configuration Notes:

*   The stack uses Traefik V3 as a reverse proxy and for managing SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt.
*   A custom Docker network `ai_stack_net` is defined, which is good for service isolation and organization.
*   Service discovery and routing are handled by Traefik labels attached to each service.

This analysis helps in understanding the configuration and prerequisites for deploying the services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

# run.sh Analysis Report

This report summarizes the analysis of the `ai-auth-stack-full/run.sh` script.

## Findings and Recommendations:

1.  **Dependency: `.env` File**
    *   The script loads environment variables from a `.env` file using `export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)`.
    *   **Consideration:** This command can be fragile if variable values contain spaces or special characters. However, it's a common pattern. Ensure the `.env` file exists and is formatted correctly (e.g., `VARIABLE="value"` or `VARIABLE=value` if no spaces).
    *   **Action:** The script should ideally check for the existence of `.env` and guide the user if missing.

2.  **Missing Directory Creation: `./kratos`**
    *   The `docker-compose.yml` file defines a volume mount ` ./kratos:/etc/config` for the `kratos` service, which requires `./kratos/kratos.yaml` and `./kratos/identity.schema.json` to exist on the host.
    *   The `run.sh` script creates `./letsencrypt` and various `./data/*` directories but **does not** create `./kratos`.
    *   **Recommendation:** Add `mkdir -p ./kratos` to the `run.sh` script. Users will still need to populate this directory with Kratos configuration files.

3.  **Missing Prerequisite Checks: Docker and Docker Compose**
    *   The script directly uses `docker compose` without checking if Docker Engine and Docker Compose V2 are installed and available.
    *   **Recommendation (Optional Enhancement):** For a more robust script, add checks for these dependencies and provide informative error messages if they are missing.

4.  **User Permissions for Docker Execution**
    *   The script executes `docker compose` without `sudo`. This requires the user running the script to be part of the `docker` group or have equivalent permissions.
    *   **Recommendation:** Document this requirement (e.g., in a README or as a comment in the script).

5.  **Misleading Supabase Access URL**
    *   The script outputs `ðŸ”¹ Supabase:    https://db.${DOMAIN}`. While Traefik routes `db.${DOMAIN}` to the PostgreSQL service, it's not a web interface. Accessing this URL in a browser will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Recommendation:** Clarify the access method. For example:
        `ðŸ”¹ Supabase DB: Accessible via Traefik at db.${DOMAIN} (PostgreSQL port 5432, SSL via Traefik)`
        Alternatively, if direct database access via Traefik is not primary, consider removing this line or rephrasing to avoid confusion.

6.  **Error Handling: `set -e`**
    *   The script does not use `set -e` (or `set -o errexit`). If a command fails (e.g., `docker compose up -d --build`), the script will continue to execute subsequent commands (like echoing success messages), which can be misleading.
    *   **Recommendation:** Add `set -e` at the beginning of the script to make it exit immediately upon any command failure.

7.  **Permissions for `acme.json`**
    *   The script correctly creates `acme.json` and sets its permissions to `600` (`chmod 600 ./letsencrypt/acme.json`). This is good practice for protecting sensitive certificate information.

8.  **Clarity of Output**
    *   The script generally provides good user feedback through `echo` statements.

By addressing these points, particularly the creation of the `./kratos` directory and improving error handling, the `run.sh` script can be made more robust and user-friendly.

# Kratos Configuration Analysis Report (`kratos.yaml`, `identity.schema.json`)

This report summarizes the analysis of the Kratos configuration files located in `ai-auth-stack-full/kratos/`.

## `kratos.yaml` Findings and Recommendations:

1.  **Critical Issue: In-Memory Database (`dsn: memory`)**
    *   **Problem:** Kratos is configured to use an in-memory database, meaning all user data, sessions, etc., will be lost upon container restart. The `--dev` flag in the `docker-compose.yml` command for Kratos also enforces this if no DSN is explicitly set.
    *   **Recommendation:** This **must** be changed for any persistent or production use.
        *   Configure Kratos to use the PostgreSQL service (`db`) provided in `docker-compose.yml`.
        *   Example DSN: `postgres://USER:PASSWORD@supabase-db:5432/kratos_database_name?sslmode=disable` (replace USER, PASSWORD, and kratos_database_name appropriately, using `${SUPABASE_DB_PASS}`).
        *   Ensure the target database (e.g., `kratos_database_name`) is created within the PostgreSQL instance.
        *   For production, remove the `--dev` flag from the Kratos service command in `docker-compose.yml` and ensure the DSN is correctly set in `kratos.yaml` or via `KRATOS_DSN` environment variable.

2.  **Important: HTTP Scheme in Self-Service URLs**
    *   **Problem:** URLs for UI flows (`selfservice.default_browser_return_url`, `selfservice.flows.*.ui_url`, `selfservice.ui.theme_url`) are set to `http://auth.${DOMAIN}/...`. However, Traefik serves `auth.${DOMAIN}` over HTTPS, and `KRATOS_BROWSER_URL` for Kratos UI was corrected to HTTPS.
    *   **Recommendation:** Change all occurrences of `http://auth.${DOMAIN}` in these settings to `https://auth.${DOMAIN}` to ensure consistency, prevent mixed content issues, and avoid potential redirect problems.
        *   `selfservice.default_browser_return_url: https://auth.${DOMAIN}/`
        *   `selfservice.flows.login.ui_url: https://auth.${DOMAIN}/login`
        *   `selfservice.flows.registration.ui_url: https://auth.${DOMAIN}/register`
        *   `selfservice.flows.settings.ui_url: https://auth.${DOMAIN}/settings`
        *   `selfservice.ui.theme_url: https://auth.${DOMAIN}/.ory/themes/default` (if applicable, though this might be a path to a theme served by Kratos UI itself rather than a full URL to be redirected to).

3.  **Production Consideration: SMTP Configuration (`courier.smtp.connection_uri`)**
    *   **Current:** Uses `smtp://smtp.mailtrap.io:2525`, suitable for testing.
    *   **Recommendation:** For production, replace with actual SMTP server details (including authentication if required, e.g., `smtp://user:pass@real-smtp-server.com:port`). This is crucial for account recovery (enabled) and email verification (if enabled).

4.  **Production Consideration: Log Level (`log.level`)**
    *   **Current:** `debug`.
    *   **Recommendation:** Change to `info` or `warn` for production environments to reduce log verbosity.

5.  **Feature Status: Email Verification (`selfservice.flows.verification.enabled`)**
    *   **Current:** `false`.
    *   **Recommendation:** If email verification is a desired feature, set this to `true` and ensure SMTP is correctly configured.

6.  **Internal URLs (`serve.public.base_url`, `serve.admin.base_url`)**
    *   These are set to `http://kratos:4433/` and `http://kratos:4434/` respectively. These are internal Docker network URLs and appear correctly configured for service-to-service communication (e.g., Kratos UI to Kratos public API).

## `identity.schema.json` Findings:

1.  **Schema Validity:**
    *   The schema defines identity traits (`email`, `name`), with `email` being required.
    *   It conforms to JSON Schema draft-07 and is correctly structured.
    *   The `$id` URI `https://schemas.ory.sh/presets/kratos/user_v0.json` suggests it might be based on a standard Ory preset.

2.  **No Issues Found:**
    *   There are no apparent misconfigurations or schema validation errors within `identity.schema.json` itself. It serves its purpose of defining the structure of identity traits.

**Primary actions based on this analysis would be to modify `kratos.yaml` to use a persistent database and HTTPS URLs for UI interactions.**
The `identity.schema.json` is suitable for use as is.
